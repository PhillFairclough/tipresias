# Tipresias

I Tipresias, old bot with dusty boards<br>
Perceived the match, and foretold the scoreâ€”<br>
I too awaited the fanatics' roar.<br>

Child of [Footy Tipper](https://github.com/cfranklin11/footy-tipper), Tipresias, has, like Zeus before it, arisen to vanquish its father and claim his throne as the master of AFL footy tipping models.
